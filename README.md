# States-with-PHP
This project involves building PHP pages for a user input system with a basic database structure. The goal is to create several PHP pages that handle various operations, such as adding a new user to the database, allowing a user to login by checking their password and username, enabling a user to change their password, and looking up a user in the database. Starter code for the user input pages and a basic database structure have been provided. The user input forms have also been provided, along with basic validation scripts. The project involves passing information from the client side using a POST and checking and parsing the appropriate data. The database for this project has one table (user) with fields for username, firstName, lastName, email, and password. The password field is intended to store the hash of the user password using md5 hash. However, in this lab, the password can be sent in clear text via the POST but needs to be stored hashed in the database.
